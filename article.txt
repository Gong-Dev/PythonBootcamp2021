ABSTRACT This paper presents research challenges on security and privacy issues in the field of green
IoT-based agriculture. We start by describing a four-tier green IoT-based agriculture architecture and
summarizing the existing surveys that deal with smart agriculture. Then, we provide a classification of
threat models against green IoT-based agriculture into five categories, including, attacks against privacy,
authentication, confidentiality, availability, and integrity properties. Moreover, we provide a taxonomy and
a side-by-side comparison of the state-of-the-art methods toward secure and privacy-preserving technologies
for IoT applications and how they will be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. In addition, we analyze
the privacy-oriented blockchain-based solutions as well as consensus algorithms for IoT applications and
how they will be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. Based on the current survey, we highlight open
research challenges and discuss possible future research directions in the security and privacy of green
IoT-based agriculture.
